# streamline-runtime

streamline.js runtime

This package contains the runtime for files that have been transformed with [streamline.js](https://github.com/Sage/streamlinejs).

It also contains the flows helper library.

See the [API documentation](./API.md) for details.

**NOTE**: the typescript type definitions have been moved to a separate package: [streamline-typings](https://github.com/Sage/streamlinejs). May be published to @types/streamline too.
